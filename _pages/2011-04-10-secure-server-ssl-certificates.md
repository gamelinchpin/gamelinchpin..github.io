Trade online safely & securely
------------------------------

In 2008 sales over the internet in the UK totalled over £222bn, up from
£65bn in 2004 (source: statistics.gov.uk). With no signs of this growth slowing down, the need for businesses to be online trading securely has never been greater.

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the globally recognised standard for
securely encrypting information being passed between a server and web
browser. The SSL Certificates we offer are exactly the same as those
being used by the leading online businesses and banks. Providing your
users with essential peace of mind, SSL certificates signify you offer
world-class data protection, increasing both trust and revenue. Websites
with SSL certificates guarantee stringent security checks are in place
to protect user’s private information, such as their bank details.

As a website owner, you can trade online safely in the knowledge that
the SSL secure connection will make sure all important information is
kept out of reach from prying eyes. Having an SSL certificate will keep
your visitors coming back time and time again, safe in the knowledge you
provide a secure service.
