internet presence and creating their own website. Ring Alpha Web Design
are fully subscribed partners to this business initiative.

Benefits for Businesses
-----------------------

With at least 41 million people in the UK online there has never been a
better time for small businesses to get online with their first website.

A website is a great way of **attracting new customers** or engaging
with existing ones, but many businesses aren't online yet because they
think its either too costly, too complicated, not necessary, or often
all three!

For businesses without a website
--------------------------------

Our range of affordable Web Design packages include everything you need
to get started.

1.  **Website address**: Choose from any available '.co.uk' website
    address. If the address is already taken, we'll suggest available
    alternatives
2.  **A customised website**
3.  **Online marketing:** All sites created will be indexed by Google,
    enabling users to easily and quickly find businesses online
4.  1yr **FREE hosting** hosting

For businesses with a website
-----------------------------

Improve your business on the web with a more professional web design,
Website Health Check or our Search Engine Optimisation.

Why choose professional web design?
-----------------------------------

While a entirely free website provided by Google Sites will get you
something online, it certainly won't be pretty and it's likely to turn
the few customers away that do stumble across it.

Remember, a website is the public face of your business, which should be
professional, well designed and make it easy for customers to find your
products & services and ultimately connect with your business.

This is the difference between a website and a successful online
business, the difference between 0 visitors and customers!

We make great websites that really put your business on the web.
