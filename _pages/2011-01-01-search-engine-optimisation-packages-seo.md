What is SEO?
------------

**Search Engine Optimisation** (**SEO**) is the process of tweaking
various areas of your website to improve it's importance to search
engines in order to appear **early and high** in **Search Engine Result
Pages** on sites like Google, Yahoo and Bing.

**Your competitors are almost certainly using SEO** to appear higher in
the search results.

Appearing earlier and higher in the search results makes is much **more
likely that your customers will visitor your site**, it's even harder if
your website isn't even on the 1st page. e.g., which one will your
customers click on?

1.  Competitor A
2.  Competitor B
3.  Competitor C
4.  Competitor D
5.  Competitor E
6.  Your Website
7.  Competitor F

Getting the 1st page won't happen by itself, **your website needs help**
and that's where SEO comes in.

The search engines constantly change the rules about how they rank
websites and therefore your site **could disappear down the ranks if
it's not constantly monitored** & up-to-date.

Unlike pay-per-click advertising, clicks on natural listings don’t cost
anything so constant **SEO** is often a **better Return On Investment**.

### Ethical SEO

There are many people out there who will use methods that Google, Yahoo
and Bing deem against their terms and they will effectively ban those
web-sites from their listings.

We adhere to search engines rules & guidelines to ensure that our
customers sites aren't banned.

### Converting Visitors to Customers

We work hard delivering vistors to your site through ethical SEO and
it's important that they have a great experience when they land on your
site or they will bounce straight out and over to your competitor.

**A great web-site converts your visitors into customers.**

### **Honest advice**

It's true to say, despite our best efforts that it isn't always
achievable and we'll be honest and give you good advice on just how
likely it is that you'll achieve your goals.

E.g., getting a high rank for the single word '*iphone*' is nearly
impossible without a great deal of money behind it. However, '*rotherham
plumber*' is a much more achievable goal.

### Our Service

We offer **various SEO packages**, as listed below, to suit all
requirements and budgets.

Some of the **Search Engine Optimisation** service we offer
include:

-   **"On-page" optimisation** – we make sure the search engines can
    find everything they need and omit everything you don't want them to
    find, like your Admin pages. Everything should support your target
    keywords.
-   **Visitor-to-Customer optimisation** – we take a look at your site
    from a customers perspective and ensure that the path from visitor
    to customer is a smooth one
-   **Full  reporting** – detailed performance reporting will accurately
    track the amount of business your extra clicks have delivered.
-   **Keyword position reporting** – meaningful reports containing
    information on how your site is performing in the real world, along
    with data on how your individual keywords are performing.

### Real people, hard work

SEO requires an understanding of not only the technical 'how to' but
also how it relates to your business and what any specific project
requires.

**How long will it take?**

It can take quite a while for your site to move up the ranks to the top
of the search results, often it will take 6 months to get there and stay
there.

It's a bit like dieting, you can stop eating for 2 weeks and claim
you've lost 1 stone or you can manage your diet, exercise and change
your lifestyle for life-long results.

Google, Bing and Yahoo are wise to the short-term bulk SEO and if often
results in those websites disappearing as fast as they appeared.

### How often should SEO be done?

To consistently appear high in the ranks requires constant effort, the
search engines change their rules, new competitors appear trying to
appear higher than you.
