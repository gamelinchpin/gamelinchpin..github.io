So, you want to write for Game Linchpin? We love to have guest writ­ers
as it gives oth­ers the abil­ity to share their ideas and beliefs about
Video Game Development with the Game Linchpin com­mu­nity. We love
get­ting dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives on dif­fer­ent top­ics, so we are
excited that you are inter­ested in writ­ing for us!

Not only is writ­ing for us a great way to share your ideas with other
peo­ple in a new com­mu­nity, but it’s a great way to get rec­og­nized
and build new rela­tion­ships. And on the side, boost your reputation!

**Canidates**
 We only accept writers from the computer games industry who can really
help to the other developers by sharing their vast knowledge and
experience.

In addition to one-off contributions we are looking for repeated guest
writers to build our knowledge base. Full attribution is always given to
the author and their business.

Writing for the blog is an outlet to share your many years of game
development experience and insight into interesting things such as Game
Development, Career, Business, Production, Contracts, Finance, People,
Management and pretty much anything else goes as long as it's related to
games / business.

### What should I write?

We're looking for articles of all shapes and sizes so anything you'd
love to share would be awesome! Of course it must be related to game
development. We're open to all ideas and will consider pretty much
anything. Almost anything goes, as long as it's well written, clean and
sounds like it comes from the heart.

We typically run pieces on the edge of game development, not the common
pieces you'll find on other web-sites. We'd love your opinion and the
more unique, inspiring, controversial and the more you talk from
experience, the better. We will not publish anything litigious, vicious,
offensive or similarly trouble worthy.

We love rich articles with imagery the really capture the flavour of the
piece. These are particularly interesting as we work in a highly visual
and creative world and it'd be awesome to get some of that in here.

Posts always have a 610x180 pixel header associated with them, and it'd
be fantastic if you can help us source that.

### What about the author?

Every other is promoted with each piece, with a clear notice where ever
the piece appears plus the post itself has a big section at the bottom
where we feature a photo of you, a link to your web-site, email and a
small bio. All of which you'll need to provide.

### What format should the submission be in?

Whilst pre-formatted HTML as below really helps, the format can be
anything from an email, word doc, or guest editing on the blog itself.

Twitter Feed contributions are welcome too in the format of related

group account via online HootSuite.

### What Guest Blogging Is
NOT: Getting It Right

Here's a little piece I found over on
[myblogguest.com](http://myblogguest.com/blog/what-guest-blogging-is-not-getting-it-right/) that captures things we want to avoid.

> <div>
>
> #### 1. Guest blogging is NOT link building in the first place
>
> I know I have emphasized link building benefits of guest posting quite
> a few
times: but if link building aspect is the first in your list of
> reasons why you start guest blogging, you are getting it WRONG from
> the very start.
>
> This way you have good chances to sacrifice on the quality of your
> content (and the strategy overall) by attempting to get as much link
> love as you can. Don’t think about building
> come naturally). Think about other (much more important!) [aims you
> are going to
achieve: brand awareness, fans and supporters,
> reputation, ***etc!***](http://myblogguest.com/blog/20-reasons-why-you-need-to-start-guest-blogging/)
>
> **If you only need link, don’t even start guest blogging. Period**
>
> Before submitting this useless stuff, try to imagine why would a
> blogger want to publish it. Remember a blogger doesn’t require
> anything in return for linking to your site. All he needs is some good
> content his readers would appreciate.
>
> </div>
>
> #### 2. Guest blogging is NOT article distribution!
>
> <div>
>
> Fellow marketers, I know you feel tempted to find a leak
here: “*Why
> would I spend 2 or more hours creating a great article and then post
> it to only one blog? Why not publish it on several blogs?”*
>
> Now, here’s my
advice: DON’T do it. You’ll just screw the
> relationships with powerful bloggers and influencers in your niche and
> achieve nothing.
>
> **Try playing by the rules and you will be amazed how much more
> effective it is!**
>
> </div>
>
> #### 3. A guest post is NOT the same as product/tool review
>
> <div>
>
> I’ve seen enough of that. Plenty of guest posts I’ve seen focus on the
> by-line: just a couple of paragraphs of mediocre content and then
> dozen of sentences describing who the author is, what he does and how
> awesome his product is.
>
> </div>
