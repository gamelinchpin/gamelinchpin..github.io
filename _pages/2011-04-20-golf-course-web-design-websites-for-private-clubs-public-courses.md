Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Q. Why do we need a nice looking website when many of our customers and
members find us by word of mouth or other golf related websites?

A. Word of mouth is great, but only *you* can say what *you* want to say
about *your* golf facility. Leaving it to other people is taking a
chance. Your website is your advertising, marketing and PR firm all
rolled up in one. Also, other golf related websites (where there are
reviews) show many other golf resorts and golf courses (i.e. your
competition). Why make that forum the only place to get your message
across?

Q. How long does it take to create a website?

A. Most websites can be finished within two weeks of start time.

Q. Why should we go with Resorts Web Design rather than our friendly
neighborhood designer?

A. There are hundreds of different types of websites and to be an expert
in all of them is all but impossible. We specialize in only a few types
of websites, one being golf courses and golf resorts. This allows us to
operate with lower overhead costs and streamline our knowledge base.
This of course gets passed on to you. More can be found on
our [blog](/blog).

Q. What makes your designs so special?

A. Not only do our design look, clean, but they are clean. Too many
websites rely on new (and old) technologies that make a website hard to
navigate and/or hard take advantage of different features. Many pop-ups
simply do not work and if you are relying on them to offer discounts and
specials, then you have wasted a lot of time, effort and money. Our
sites are html and/or CSS compliant. That means they work across
different platforms.. For more on this, please give us a
call:
1-877-655-7276.
