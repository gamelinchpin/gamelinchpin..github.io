I put together some writing tips to help guide you on your merry way
should you wish to [Write For Us](/write-for-us).

In general we're looking for well written, clear articles that take
about 1 minute to read. The articles must be relevant to games
development and be written by someone with a good industry track record.
Prior experience of writing isn't important.
 In order to make something exciting, here's a few tips

-   **Create Something Unique** – Don’t just do what has already been
    done and expect people to think it is cool. If you have found
    something like it then expect that your readers have too!
-   **Create Something Useful** – Make sure that the resource you create
    is something your readers actually need. Ask yourself if the
    resource would ever be used by yourself? My favorite and most
    successful resources and posts are often the ones I like to go back
    to myself! (I know it’s kind of vain )
-   **Create Something Citable** – A post that can be referred to over
    and over again. Great posts are often quoted, linked to, and
    referred to in other blogs and future posts. So make sure it is
    formatted so your best content is easily found and
    references would be enticing.

#### How To Write

-   Be Human
-   Innovate
-   Tell a Story
-   Fix a Problem
-   Listen to your audience

### Types Of Post

While we are happy with pretty much any contribution from a games
industry veteran we are always on the lookout for a few things, which
will typically get posted up first.

We are currently desperate for giant list posts with over 100 items in
them, we'd ideally like to post up one of these per month. E.g., tips
for new starts, naming great people, UK developers, Top Freelancers,
etc.

**Indepth**

-   Long (1000+ words)
-   Evergreen, content is always fresh, relevant for months, years to
    come.
-   Comment Worthy. Inspires discussion. Active subscribers.

**Long tail blog post**

-   Problem Solver (How To, Product Review)

**Fun blog post**

### HTML Post Formatting

Here are some guidelines on how to format you're HTML version of your
article. All articles will end up this way and it'd be appreciated if
you could find the time to tweak it so it's to your liking.

#### Expla­na­tion of Post Tags

In our posts, we like to include a lot of dif­fer­ent HTML tags to make
our posts look great. Here is an expla­na­tion of the ones we use the
most and how to call them.

#### h3 Tag {style="font: normal 1.7em Rockwell, Georgia; text-transform: none;"}

The `<h3>` tag is the head­ing tag used to talk about the most
impor­tant information

#### h4 Tag

The `<h4>` is used usu­ally within the h3 tag to dis­play lower lev­eled
information.

##### h5 Tag

The `<h5>` tag is usu­ally used within the h4 tag to dis­play even lower
lev­eled information

###### h6 Tag

The `<h6>` is used to dis­play the copy­right infor­ma­tion of any
images used from other sites such as [Flickr](http://flickr.com/) for
example.

To cre­ate a drop cap for the first let­ter of the first para­graph in
your post, just use this piece of code and place the first let­ter of
the word
within: `<span class="drop_cap"></span>`

When you are quot­ing some­one, it is usu­ally accept­able to use the
`>blockquote<` tag to wrap the quoted text in. There are three
dif­fer­ent kinds of for­mat­ting of block­quotes we use here that you
can eas­ily use to dis­play your quotes.

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, con­secte­tur adip­isic­ing elit, sed do
> eius­mod tem­por inci­didunt ut labore et dolore magna ali­qua. Ut
> enim ad minim veniam, quis nos­trud exerci­ta­tion ullamco laboris
> nisi ut aliquip ex ea com­modo con­se­quat. Duis aute irure dolor in
> rep­re­hen­derit in volup­tate velit esse cil­lum dolore eu fugiat
> nulla pariatur. Excep­teur sint occae­cat cup­i­datat non proident,
> sunt in culpa qui offi­cia deserunt mol­lit anim id est laborum.

> This is a pul­lquote that floats to the left of text

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, con­secte­tur adip­isic­ing elit, sed do
eius­mod tem­por inci­didunt ut labore et dolore magna ali­qua. Ut enim
ad minim veniam, quis nos­trud exerci­ta­tion ullamco laboris nisi ut
aliquip ex ea com­modo con­se­quat. Duis aute irure dolor in
rep­re­hen­derit in volup­tate velit esse cil­lum dolore eu fugiat nulla
pariatur. Excep­teur sint occae­cat cup­i­datat non proident, sunt in
culpa qui offi­cia deserunt mol­lit anim id est laborum.

> And this text floats to the right of the paragraph

Sed ut per­spi­ci­atis unde omnis iste natus error sit volup­tatem
accu­san­tium doloremque lau­dan­tium, totam rem ape­riam, eaque ipsa
quae ab illo inven­tore ver­i­tatis et quasi archi­tecto beatae vitae
dicta sunt explic­abo. Nemo enim ipsam volup­tatem quia volup­tas sit
asper­natur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia con­se­qu­un­tur magni dolores
eos qui ratione volup­tatem sequi nesciunt.

-   `<blockquote>Text here</blockquote>`
-   `<blockquote class="left">Text here</blockquote>`
-   `<blockquote class="right">Text here</blockquote>`

If you have any notes you would like to include in your text, just wrap
that text in a new para­graph within this
tag: \<p
class=“note”>\</p><span class="flip"> </span>

If there is an alert of spe­cial warn­ing you need to empha­size, wrap a
new para­graph within this
tag: \<p class=“alert”>\</p>
