We believe that web hosting is more than just providing web space and
FTP access. Our aim is to provide individuals and businesses with
everything they need to express themselves on the internet, be that
through an idea or selling goods and services. Whatever you want to
create a website for, be it a small family photo album or a full powered
data base driven ecommerce website, your choice of web host is
essential. The right web host will make the difference between a slow
clunky site that has regular down time and a site that is always
available and blisteringly fast!

Web hosting terminology
-----------------------

New to web hosting? Here are some of the most common terms used...

### Bandwidth

A term used by web hosts to describe how much data can pass from the
server your website is hosted on to people visiting your web site. This
includes the files that make up your website as well as any data
downloaded from databases or media files.

### ccTLD

A country code top level domain name. These domain names are associated
with a country or geographic location e.g. .co.uk (UK), .fr (France and
.cn (China). The ability to register these domain names from another
country depends on the registrar's rules. For example, co.uk has no
restrictions whereas .it (Italy) demands you are based in Europe.

### Domain Name System

The system that maps domain names to the corresponding machine's IP
addresses. This system is essentially a phone book that translates human
friendly names into computer friendly numbers. Because this information
is stored across multiple computers any updates to a domain (including
registration and ownership details) can take up to 48 hours to work its
way across all of them.

### File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

Once you are ready to see what your website looks like online, uploading
the files to your web space is really easy and is often as simple as
clicking, dragging and dropping. The method you will use to get your
website online is called File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Don't be put off
by the name, all this does is take the files from your computer and put
them on to the web host's server for people to access. Simple!

In order to do this your web host may offer an upload function though
your account with them, but that means you have to log in every time. A
quicker alternative that most people use is FTP software. Some HTML
editors come with this built in (e.g. Dreamweaver & Microsoft Expression
Web) but even if yours doesn't there is the industry standard stand
alone (which is free) to download called FileZilla.

### HTML

HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language) is the first layer of a web page and
deals with the content (the text, any lists, tables, quotes...).

### LAMP

LAMP is an acronym used to describe a set of open source software used
by many people and businesses to save money and to prevent platform
lock-in.
 **Linux:** Operating system

**Apache:** Web server

**MySQL:** Database

**PHP:** Program

### MySQL

MySQL (owned and developed by Sun Microsystems) is the world's most
popular open source database. It is also part of the open source
software stack known as LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).

### Sub-Domain

Sub-domain names are domains that are part of the parent domain name.
They are free to set up and can be useful if you have areas of your site
you want to categorise e.g.
 dictionary.domain.com, thesaurus.domain.com

### TLD

Top Level Domain Names have no association with any countries and were
amongst the first to be created. E.g. .com, .net, .org.

### Web Space

The amount of space allocated to your website by a web host to store all
your files and data. The more web space you have the more information
you can store.
