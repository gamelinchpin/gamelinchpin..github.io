### Owner

![](assets/Head2010-150x150.jpg "Simeon Pashley")My name is Simeon
Pashley and I have been **professionally developing software since
1986**. During my career, I have worked in every size of business from
1-man army, 5-man teams, all the way up to running multi-million pound
contracts (*not that I got much of it*) for some of the worlds biggest
companies including Sony, LEGO and Electronic Arts so **I appreciate the

I'm a programmer by trade and I have a particular interest in emerging
technologies and **delivering affordable, well designed, robust, secure
experiences**. I have a vast amount of experience with software,
programming languages, servers, clients, devices and networking to name

I also **write games and applications for iOS** (iPhone, iPad, iPod
Touch) and **Android** when I get a few minutes to spare.

I also have formal training in many areas including from **London
Business School** on Strategy, Finance and People as well as being an

inside out enabling me to get the most out every opportunity for your
