| ![100% Cisco Gigabit                 | ### 100% Cisco Gigabit Network       |
| Network](assets/logo_cisco.png)      |                                      |
|                                      | Our network operates on              |
|                                      | industry-leading network equipment   |
|                                      | from Cisco Systems. All our switches |
|                                      | and routers are developed by Cisco.  |
|                                      | Our network is based on 10 gigabit   |
|                                      | technology, which means that it runs |
|                                      | at a speed of 10000 Mb per second -  |
|                                      | most web hosting networks are        |
|                                      | limited to much less.                |
|                                      |                                      |
|                                      | Our network also utilises 100% CAT6  |
|                                      | network cable, which contains four   |
|                                      | pairs of copper wire and, unlike     |
|                                      | CAT5, utilises all four pairs. CAT6  |
|                                      | supports Gigabit (1000 Mbps)         |
|                                      | Ethernet and supports communications |
|                                      | at more than twice the speed of      |
|                                      | CAT5e, which is the other popular    |
|                                      | standard for Gigabit Ethernet        |
|                                      | cabling.                             |

| ![Connectivity](assets/icon_lan.png) | ### Connectivity                     |
|                                      |                                      |
|                                      | We operates a multi-homed network    |
|                                      | utilising BGP4 technology. Simply    |
|                                      | put, we have multiple connections to |
|                                      | the Internet with different backbone |
|                                      | providers, should any connection     |
|                                      | fail our other connections           |
|                                      | automatically take all the traffic.  |
|                                      | Not only does this mean that we are  |
|                                      | very unlikely to lose connectivity   |
|                                      | to the Internet, but it also means   |
|                                      | that traffic moving to and from our  |
|                                      | network can choose from a range of   |
|                                      | paths to get to its final            |
|                                      | destination. This means that we have |
|                                      | been able to configure the network   |
|                                      | always to take the fastest paths.    |

FAQs
----

#### What type of hardware do you use?

All our servers are genuine Dell Servers. If you are comparing Heart
Internet to other providers please be aware that many companies make
"homemade" servers using home computer motherboards in fabricated boxes.

#### What level of access do I have to my server?

You will have full root or administrator privileges to manage and access
your server.

#### Is there any software installed on the server to help me configure it?

Yes, if you have chosen our Linux CentOS installation then we
automatically install WebMin. WebMin is a web based control panel that
allows you to do system administration tasks such as configure Apache or
setup users. If you want the easiest management possible then we would
suggest you add cPanel to your server.

#### I need to reboot my server, how can I arrange this?

You can reboot your server any time you like. Just visit the "Manage
Dedicated Servers" area of your control panel and click the real time
reboot option.

#### How much bandwidth do I get?

Your server comes with a 10mb connection to the Internet (10240 Kbps),
It's just like having your own leased line. You can transfer as much
data as you like within your 10mb line. Don't get this confused with
your broadband at home or work; you don't share your 10mb with anyone
else. 10mb is a huge amount of bandwidth which can support a very busy
website, it roughly translates to 2560 GB of bandwidth a month.

#### Do you have any restrictions on what I can use my server for?

No, as long as anything you do on the server abides with UK law then you
are free to use the server for any purpose.

#### Can I use my server to host videos, stream audio or store large backups?

Yes, you can use your server for any purpose you need.

#### Where will my server be located?

Your server will be based in our UK Data Centre.

#### Does the server run RAID disk mirroring?

Yes, all our servers are setup with hardware level RAID mirroring. In
the unlikely event of a disk failure this means your server will
continue to operate normally. We will be notified of the disk failure
and will replace the broken disk for you with no cost or impact to your
data or service.
