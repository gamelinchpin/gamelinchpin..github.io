Game Linchpin is a web-site setup dedicated to act as a repository for
all the things I've learned during my career so far and things I pick up
on a regular basis.

My blog focuses on interesting articles about Game Development,
Production, Career, Business, Contracts, Finance, People and much more.

I hope you enjoy Game Linchpin and join in the conversation. I can't
wait to hear from you.

feature other authors who have often submitted interesting articles
relevant to Game Development.

#### Simeon

[![](assets/IMG_4281-e1276213790885-152x300.jpg "Photo taken a promo photo shoot for our game")](/about/about-simeon)My
name is Simeon Pashley and I'm a Contract Game Development Executive
with over 20 years of development experience from Programming to running
a complete Development Studio and everywhere in between.

Fint out more about me via [my online portfolio](/contact).

**Why Blog?**\
 As the owner and originator, I started to put together this blog to
share all the knowledge I've acquired over the years in a hope that
someone else can enjoy it and make use of it.

I also wanted to bring in some of my experienced friends too and give
them a voice, as they are often the unsung heroes of game development,
often plug away behind the lines, making a solid difference in the
projects they work on.
