**Search Engine Marketing** is a critical aspect of doing business on
the web in the 21st century as customers are using search engines such
as Google, Yahoo and Bing to find the content and businesses they are
looking for.

Using Google as an example, there are 2 ways of getting exposure early
and high in the **Search Engine Results Pages** (SERP) both of which
require some effort, **SEO** and **Pay-Per-Click Advertising**.

### Search Engine Optimisation

When customers search, the main portion of the **Search Engine Results
Page** contains all of the **Organic Results**, i.e., the results that
were found naturally and weren't paid for. To **appear early and high**
in the Search Engine Results Page requires some **Search Engine
Optimisation**, or **SEO** for short, of your website to encourage the
search engines like Google to consider your content more important, and
therefore appear higher, than your competitors.

**Pay-per-click Advertising** are the paid ads that appear around the
regular search results based on key words the person was searching for.
The advertisers pays a small fee out of an allocated budget, often
pence, every time a customer clicks on one of their ads where ever it
appears.

These PPC ads can also appear automatically in banner ads on lots of
other websites around the web, maybe even your competitors.
