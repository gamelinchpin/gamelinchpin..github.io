### How and Why I use Social Networks such as LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. A Social Networking Policy

My policy helps me manage the expectations of my network. When everyone
knows what to expect, they won’t be upset if, for example, I connect
with them on LinkedIn, but haven’t “friended” them on Facebook.

To keep things simple, I’ve placed my policy in chart form for easy
reference. I also have a more detailed Twitter Policy (bottom) as I use
Twitter the most and feel it requires specifics.

Feel free to contact me as stipulated on the appropriate network. I also
appreciate feedback, so please leave a comment on my blog. It encourages
conversation not only between both of us, but by other visitors.

### TWITTER FOLLOWING POLICY

This Following Policy is specifically for Twitter and was established so
that my Followers can clearly understand why I may or may not follow
them back, and how quickly they can expect me to start following. To be
sure, this is not my entire process. When I learn that someone is
following me I usually do things like look at their Profile page, review
some of their comments and Favorites, and look at who they follow and
who is following them, etc.

I highly recommend that all Twitter users adopt policies of their own. I
believe it will help reduce churn and make Twittering a better
experience for all.
