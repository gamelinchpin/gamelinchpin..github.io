There are many ways in which I can help during Game Development and here
are a few
ideas:

### Publishers

I can help to ensure that the projects are well planned, managed and
within the capabilities of the team. I can additionally ensure that the
teams are on the right path from the very outset and understand the
expectations.

### Developers

There are a multitude of ways in which I can help you succeed covering
all of the people, business and project aspects. Please take a look at
my 'How Can I Help?' page for more details.
 Need help getting your ideas down on paper and getting all of those
important documents together while you're busy focusing on the game?
 Need some Senior / Executive guidance when starting out on a new
venture and need to make sure it's heading in the right direction?

### Contributors

I can help connect you with the right teams and projects that make the
most of your expertise & services.

### Agents / Recruiters

I can help ensure projects are started in the right way and are
appropriately staffed and funded. Proper planning and monitor ensure
timely delivery and improved cashflow.

### Universities, Writers / Educators / Trainers

My vast experience enables me to talk about game development at all
levels, including generally how games are made, tips on getting a job,
what to expect in the real world, ideas about where games are going and
much more.
 Guest Lecturing on subjects such as starting out in games, production,
commercial success and much more.

### Legal

I have a great wealth of experience and practical knowledge that enable
me to act as an Expert Witness should the need arise.
