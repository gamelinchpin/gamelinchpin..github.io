<p>I always get a warm fuzzy feeling when I get to know that people enjoyed the games I made all those years ago...in todays world it's relatively easy to find people who were previously shrouded in mystery and you could never reach them.</p>
<p><strong>Do you connect with people who make things you enjoy?</strong> </p>

<h3>Arabian Knights (via satansam@YouTube)</h3>

<p>Just a little message to say this game was one of the staple games of my childhood. There was one level I could never get past, I think it was on a pirate ship... by that point in the game I had no lives left so it was a struggle for a 10 year old xD.</p>
<p>But yea. You programmed a brilliant game. Every part of that game was well made, the controls, the music, the artwork. Great stuff.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, cheerio!</p>
