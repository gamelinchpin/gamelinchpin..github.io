Is middleware replacing talented, creative developers? Is everything
becoming mass produced?

<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">

Our industries echos the early days of the industrial revolution where
machines replaced talent and workers were inter-changeable, the cheapest
people worked.
During the industrial revolution businesses replaced highly skilled but
slow workers with machines and cheap labour. The products were
technically better and more cost effective but the skill was driven out
of the business and interchangeable workers were brought in. New
mediocre products appeared at a phenomenal rate as they were churned out
and ultimately mass produced. At one point, almost 50% of cars on the
planet were one specific model!

In today's world, you could take this further by documenting the process
and ship it and the machinery over to where the labour is cheapest.
After all, anyone can do that job can't they? Non-native customer
support call centres ring any bells?

</div>

Echo's of this are happening now. Game Engines like Unreal Engine 3 are
the Victorian machines, drone artists who can produce 3D facsimile of
concept art, level designers following tried and trusted methods,
managers who follow methodologies, anyone being trained in how to do one
specific interchangeable job without thought. It's an easy life but
ultimately there's a lot of people who can get that far up the career
ladder very quickly, and for much less pay.

<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">

This all comes crashing down when things change. Where are the people
who think for themselves? Where are the ones who can come up with new
ways of doing something? Who's looking out for the future?
<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">

This is all very sad if we destroy the creativity that we all claim to
have by churning products out by the numbers to satisfy some
demographic.

</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">

Don't get me wrong, I completely get that some of this is necessary but
I would ask : Where do you fit into all of this? Are you, your business
or your game an inter-changeable cog?
